# Software Engineer (ML & LLMs) Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the **Software Engineer (ML & LLMs)** Application Challenge. In this, you will have the opportunity to get closer to a part of the reality of the role, and demonstrate your skills and knowledge in machine learning and cloud.

## Problem

A jupyter notebook (`exploration.ipynb`) has been provided with the work of a Data Scientist (from now on, the DS). The DS, trained a model to predict the probability of **delay** for a flight taking off or landing at SCL airport. The model was trained with public and real data, below we provide you with the description of the dataset:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`Fecha-I`|Scheduled date and time of the flight.|
|`Vlo-I`|Scheduled flight number.|
|`Ori-I`|Programmed origin city code.|
|`Des-I`|Programmed destination city code.|
|`Emp-I`|Scheduled flight airline code.|
|`Fecha-O`|Date and time of flight operation.|
|`Vlo-O`|Flight operation number of the flight.|
|`Ori-O`|Operation origin city code.|
|`Des-O`|Operation destination city code.|
|`Emp-O`|Airline code of the operated flight.|
|`DIA`|Day of the month of flight operation.|
|`MES`|Number of the month of operation of the flight.|
|`AÃ‘O`|Year of flight operation.|
|`DIANOM`|Day of the week of flight operation.|
|`TIPOVUELO`|Type of flight, I =International, N =National.|
|`OPERA`|Name of the airline that operates.|
|`SIGLAORI`|Name city of origin.|
|`SIGLADES`|Destination city name.|

In addition, the DS considered relevant the creation of the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`high_season`|1 if `Date-I` is between Dec-15 and Mar-3, or Jul-15 and Jul-31, or Sep-11 and Sep-30, 0 otherwise.|
|`min_diff`|difference in minutes between `Date-O` and `Date-I`|
|`period_day`|morning (between 5:00 and 11:59), afternoon (between 12:00 and 18:59) and night (between 19:00 and 4:59), based on `Date-I`.|
|`delay`|1 if `min_diff` > 15, 0 if not.|

## Challenge

### Instructions

1. Create a repository in **github** and copy all the challenge content into it. Remember that the repository must be **public**.

2. Use the **main** branch for any official release that we should review. It is highly recommended to use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) development practices. **NOTE: do not delete your development branches.**
   
3. Please, do not change the structure of the challenge (names of folders and files).
   
4. All the documentation and explanations that you have to give us must go in the `challenge.md` file inside `docs` folder.

5. To send your challenge, you must do a `POST` request to:
    `https://advana-challenge-check-api-cr-k4hdbggvoq-uc.a.run.app/software-engineer`
    This is an example of the `body` you must send:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Juan Perez",
      "mail": "juan.perez@example.com",
      "github_url": "https://github.com/juanperez/latam-challenge.git",
      "api_url": "https://juan-perez.api"
    }
    ```
    ##### ***PLEASE, SEND THE REQUEST ONCE.***

    If your request was successful, you will receive this message:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "OK",
      "detail": "your request was received"
    }
    ```


***NOTE: We recommend to send the challenge even if you didn't manage to finish all the parts.***

### Context:

We need to operationalize the data science work for the airport team. For this, we have decided to enable an `API` in which they can consult the delay prediction of a flight.

*We recommend reading the entire challenge (all its parts) before you start developing.*

### Part I

In order to operationalize the model, transcribe the `.ipynb` file into the `model.py` file:

- If you find any bug, fix it.
- The DS proposed a few models in the end. Choose the best model at your discretion, argue why. **It is not necessary to make improvements to the model.**
- Apply all the good programming practices that you consider necessary in this item.
- The model should pass the tests by running `make model-test`.

> **Note:**
> - **You cannot** remove or change the name or arguments of **provided** methods.
> - **You can** change/complete the implementation of the provided methods.
> - **You can** create the extra classes and methods you deem necessary.

### Part II

Deploy the model in an `API` with `FastAPI` using the `api.py` file.

- The `API` should pass the tests by running `make api-test`.

> **Note:** 
> - **You cannot** use other framework.

### Part III

Deploy the `API` in your favorite cloud provider (we recomend to use GCP).

- Put the `API`'s url in the `Makefile` (`line 26`).
- The `API` should pass the tests by running `make stress-test`.

> **Note:** 
> - **It is important that the API is deployed until we review the tests.**

### Part IV

We are looking for a proper `CI/CD` implementation for this development.

- Create a new folder called `.github` and copy the `workflows` folder that we provided inside it.
- Complete both `ci.yml` and `cd.yml`(consider what you did in the previous parts).
